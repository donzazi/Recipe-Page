## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I've learned basic HTML and CSS. I learned a little about how styling can be applied or ignored based on how HTML is structured.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about CSS. I want to learn how the pseudo works and mediaqueries.
I also want to learn padding and margin.

### Useful resources

- Github-CoPilot - Helped me with why my JS file didn't register.
- Chatgpt - Helped me with identation and mediaqueries.
